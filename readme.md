ashuffle integration root
========

This repo is part of the [ashuffle](https://github.com/joshkunz/ashuffle)
project. It contains the scripts needed to generate the base integration
testing image. This is generated separately to speed up the test runtime. It
does not depend on ashuffle, or MPD or libmpdclient directly.
